		<p>Atlantis has been taken over by a men's right group and it's up to you to liberate it. This game is about
		redemption and liberation. It's also about mending a broken relationship and trying to save the world
		from sinister threats. Are you bad enough to play it?</p>
		
		<p> Features of this game:
			<ul>
				<li>Multiple bullet types!</li>
				<li>Lots of bosses!</li>

			</ul>
		</p>
